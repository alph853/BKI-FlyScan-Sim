# Waypoint Mission Configuration
# Define a list of waypoints for the drone to visit sequentially
# All positions are in the map frame, altitudes in NED (negative = up)

  # Mission parameters
  waypoint_tolerance: 0.5          # Distance tolerance to consider waypoint reached (m)
  hover_time: 3.0                  # Time to hover at each waypoint (seconds)
  max_velocity: 1.0                # Maximum velocity between waypoints (m/s)
  safety_margin: 1.5               # Safety margin for obstacle avoidance (m)
  
  # List of waypoints to visit
  # Each waypoint has: position (x,y,z), orientation (yaw in degrees), and optional work_time
